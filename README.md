# Simplified and Machine Learning Model for NPP

Simplified Models:
The code "f_method_1.m" is used to calculate thermodynamic performance parameters of water-cooled reactors nuclear power plants (NPP) using Simplified Model 1.
The code "f_method_2.m" is used to calculate thermodynamic performance parameters of other reactor-based NPPs using Simplified Model 2.
To run these two codes, download “X Steam v1.0.0.0” from MATLAB website.

Artificial Neural Network (ANN) Models:
The code "ANN_M1.m" is used to calculate thermodynamic performance parameters of water-cooled reactors nuclear power plants (NPP) using ANN Model 1.
The code "ANN_M2.m" is used to calculate thermodynamic performance parameters of other reactor-based NPPs using ANN Model 2.
